## Project Approach

Our first step was to think about the design and content of our future site(Getflix). We did a lot of research on the internet to acquire enough knowledge before tacliking the Project.

### Tools used

Secondly, we had to use Docker, MyPHPAdmin and MariaDB to be able to create a local server and Getflix database.

- we used API Movie DB (TMDB Service) to fetch movies and images
- Inside the DB, we created tables to manage the Getflix Users who will be logging in or registering
- We used Mysql workbench to create tables and their relationship
- Installed and configured Trello for Team collaboration
- Discord was used for Project communication's purpose
- Github Platform is always used to host our Projects
- Git bash and Vs Code were also used for codding
- Lastly we used HTML, CSS and JS to ensure the website is properly structured, formatting and responded to the coath needs.

#### Deployment

We ensured all the pages were linked and displayed their contents appropriately within the time line.

#### Team Members

Mitsu Suchak
Poorani Karunanithi

The above members formed a nice group and worked as a team to ensure the Project completion is done within the timeline and evrything works accordingly. The design and the API connection of the main Home page was done by Mitsu. Rajab and Poorani were in charge of the backend. Furthermore, we ensured everyone of us worked on both front and backend in order to improve our skills on both technologies .
